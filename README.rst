Cookiecutter Static Page Proxy
=======================

Static Page Proxy: https://github.com/joelslee/static_page_proxy

This cookiecutter template aims to automate the creation of static page proxy
implemented projects easily and with as minimal tweaking as possible.


Usage
------

The usage is exactly the same as other cookiecutter templates.

First, install Cookiecutter::

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/ayhanefe/cookiecutter-static-page-proxy

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a proxy installed project
will be created for you.
